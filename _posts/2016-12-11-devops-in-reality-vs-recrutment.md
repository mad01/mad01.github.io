The question is what is devops? How do you recrute a devops engineer. The short answer is you don't. a devops engineer does not exist.

The thing about recruting a so called devops engineer is all a big miss understanding of the bussword all head hunters and recruters love.

So if we look at it a bit in short first, what is devops! devops is a way of working in a engineering organisation. The way of working generally means a few thing. You start by moving the organisation from a `itil` or `waterfall` to a more `agile` way of working. What this means is that you strive to have a culture allows pepole fredom under responsability, short developemnt cyeles, allowing quick adoption and changes, to move fast, one big part here is `trust` in the engineers.

When we look at the operations organisation, this is very different. when you try do move in to a devops/agile way of working. This often means that you do deployments deily. The traditinal ops works is to have a handover and some documentation


as i see it devops have two main grops, engineering culture, opperations culture. knowing that lets add a therd group infrastructure engineering culture. 

if we break down the tre groups a bit to explaing what devops/none devops means for the different grops, and what the extra grops brings. 
## engineering culture
### none devops 
### devops

## opperations culture
### none devops 
the ops team have a handover process, that gets a tested and proven build delivered hopfully some documentaiton, on how to run, and take care of that application. the ops team often tries to minimize the amount of deploys. Since the time to get a fix is long, a deploy is risky and can break production. So the result is that you get a long time from development to delivery. a fall is formed between engineering and opperations which often dissagre about deployments to prduction and it's a bit of a friction between the two groups. engineers break things and ops gets to fix it. 
### devops
Ops have a agreement with engineering that deployments can be done when they like as 


## ingrastructure engineering culture
