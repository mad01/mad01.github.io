Brew some easy and good cold brew coffee. This can be used for just plain ice coffee, ice latte, and many more. A note it that it will be high in caffeine. What you need is. 

* a one liter jar
* coffee beans `newly roasted preferred`
* water `filtered preferred`
* a french press

Start by milling coffee. you what medium size grounds. Put the grounds in the jar, you what to have the jar filled 1/4 with coffee grounds. Now fill the jar with water. stir the coffee grounds so all of it gets wet. A note is if the coffee is rosted the a few days before you should *NOT* close the jar since it grounds will release some `CO2`. Now the hard part is to wait. You should leave it for minimum of 24 hours and up to 48 hours. Store it in the fridge or somewhere cold. After the 24 to 48 hours use the french press to separate the water and coffee grounds. You can now store it in the fridge for up to a week.
