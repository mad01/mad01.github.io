      <title>dynamic test generation</title>
      <link>qone.io/testing/python/2015/03/14/test-generation.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I what to show a api template i did to generate api post tests with a random varible lenght hex value as the payload in a http post request. In this case i am using python, in compination with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nose.readthedocs.org&quot;&gt;nose&lt;/a&gt;, to run my tests. Note you can run this without nose but you will get all prints from the support libs. Nose will supress the prints if the test passes. To change to varible number of tests that you can generate you just change the `random_data input integer. The purpose of this is to be able to check that a REST api can take the random input length of the hex payload. in the testmap you gets a dict that contains a random, int, float, hex, password. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping up with tech. I like read and be aware of what is going on in tech, security, apple, linux, development, testing, and some devops related topics. I have attached a &lt;code&gt;OPML&lt;/code&gt; file from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedly.com&quot;&gt;feedly&lt;/a&gt; where i get most of my news if your interested. I am frequently listening to a few podcasts, I&amp;#39;m using a awesome podcast iPhone` app &lt;a href=&quot;https://overcast.fm/&quot;&gt;overcast&lt;/a&gt; to litsen. The smart speed saves some time, voice boost helps to boost the voice those is the features i think it best for me. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>control temptation @ work</title>
      <link>qone.io/temptation/2015/03/04/control-temptation-at-work.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So what do i mean with &lt;code&gt;control temptation @ work&lt;/code&gt;. When working with development you have to get it to a problem and try to solve it. Doing that requires that you can stay focused on the task in hand to get the most out of it. Lets say you take 10 - 15 min to get it to the right flow. During your day you have email, facebook, online newspapers, chat systems like &lt;code&gt;IRC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;HipChat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Skype&lt;/code&gt;, colleagues and many others things that can make you get out of your productive flow. The result of this will mean for every time you lose the 10 - 15 min to get in to the productive flow, over and over. And you may end up at the end of that day and realizing that you did not get done with what you wanted. That is not fun for anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
